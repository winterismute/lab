*DeepMind Lab* is a 3D learning environment based on id Software's
[Quake III Arena](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena) via
[ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) and
[other open source software](#upstream-sources).

*DeepMind Lab* provides a suite of challenging 3D navigation and puzzle-solving
tasks for learning agents. Its primary purpose is to act as a testbed for
research in artificial intelligence, especially deep reinforcement learning.

## About

Disclaimer: This is not an official Google product.

If you use *DeepMind Lab* in your research and would like to cite
the *DeepMind Lab* environment, we suggest you cite
the [DeepMind Lab paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03801).

You can reach us at [lab@deepmind.com](mailto:lab@deepmind.com).

## About this fork

This is an **independently maintained** fork of the original DeepMind Lab used for some small (and rather pointless) experiments.
Some of the branches contain fixes and additional functionalities: you can always check the updated documentation files to learn about them.

## Getting started on Linux

* Get [Bazel from bazel.io](http://bazel.io/docs/install.html).

* Clone DeepMind Lab, e.g. by running

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/deepmind/lab
$ cd lab
```

* For a live example of a random agent, run

```shell
lab$ bazel run :random_agent --define headless=false -- \
               --length=10000 --width=640 --height=480
```

Here is some [more detailed build documentation](docs/build.md),
including how to install dependencies if you don't have them.

### Play as a human

To test the game using human input controls, run

```shell
lab$ bazel run :game -- --level_script tests/demo_map
```

### Train an agent

*DeepMind Lab* ships with an example random agent in
[`python/random_agent.py`](python/random_agent.py)
which can be used as a starting point for implementing a learning agent. To let
this agent interact with DeepMind Lab for training, run

```shell
lab$ bazel run :random_agent
```

The Python API for the agent-environment interaction is described
in [docs/python_api.md](docs/python_api.md).

*DeepMind Lab* ships with different levels implementing different tasks. These
tasks can be configured using Lua scripts,
as described in [docs/lua_api.md](docs/lua_api.md).

-----------------

## Upstream sources

*DeepMind Lab* is built from the *ioquake3* game engine, and it uses the tools
*q3map2* and *bspc* for map creation. Bug fixes and cleanups that originate
with those projects are best fixed upstream and then merged into *DeepMind Lab*.

* *bspc* is taken from [github.com/TTimo/bspc](https://github.com/TTimo/bspc),
  revision e6f90a2dc02916aa2298da6ace70a8333b3f2405. There are virtually no
  local modifications, although we integrate this code with the main ioq3 code
  and do not use their copy in the `deps` directory. We expect this code to be
  stable.

* *q3map2* is taken from
  [github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant](https://github.com/TTimo/GtkRadiant),
  revision 8557f1820f8e0c7cef9d52a78b2847fa401a4a95. A few minor local
  modifications add synchronization and use C99 constructs to replace
  formerly non-portable or undefined behaviour. We also expect this code to be
  stable.

* *ioquake3* is taken from
  [github.com/ioquake/ioq3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3),
  revision 1c1e1f61f180596c925a4ac0eddba4806d1369cd. The code contains extensive
  modifications and additions. We aim to merge upstream changes occasionally.

We are very grateful to the maintainers of these repositories for all their hard
work on maintaining high-quality code bases.

## External dependencies, prerequisites and porting notes

*DeepMind Lab* currently ships as source code only. It depends on a few external
software libraries, which we ship in several different ways:

 * The `zlib`, `glib`, `libxml2`, `jpeg` and `png` libraries are referenced as
   external Bazel sources, and Bazel BUILD files are provided. The dependent
   code itself should be fairly portable, but the BUILD rules we ship are
   specific to Linux on x86. To build on a different platform you will most
   likely have to edit those BUILD files.

 * Message digest algorithms are included in this package (in
   [`//third_party/md`](third_party/md)), taken from the reference
   implementations of their respective RFCs. A "generic reinforcement learning
   API" is included in [`//third_party/rl_api`](third_party/rl_api), which has
   also been created by the *DeepMind Lab* authors. This code is portable.

 * Several additional libraries are required but are not shipped in any form;
   they must be present on your system:
   * SDL 2
   * Lua 5.1 (later versions might work, too)
   * gettext (required by `glib`)
   * OpenGL: a hardware driver and library are needed for hardware-accelerated
     human play, and OSMesa is required for the software-rendering, headless
     library that machine learning agents will want to use.
   * Python 2.7 (other versions might work, too)

The build rules are using a few compiler settings that are specific to GCC. If
some flags are not recognized by your compiler (typically those would be
specific warning suppressions), you may have to edit those flags. The warnings
should be noisy but harmless.
